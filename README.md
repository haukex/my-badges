Badge Generation to GitHub Pages
================================

This repository primarily contains a GitHub Actions Workflow that uses
[`Badge::Simple`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Badge::Simple)
to generate badges for [CPAN Testers](https://cpantesters.org/)
(like this one:
![CPAN Testers](https://haukex.github.io/my-badges/Badge-Simple.svg))
and deploys them to GitHub Pages.
