Badge Generation to GitHub Pages
================================

This repository primarily contains a GitHub Actions Workflow that uses
[`Badge::Simple`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Badge::Simple)
to generate badges for [CPAN Testers](https://cpantesters.org/)
(like this one:
![CPAN Testers](https://haukex.github.io/my-badges/Badge-Simple.svg))
for my Perl modules and deploys them to GitHub Pages.

It uses the utility script
<https://github.com/haukex/Badge-Simple/blob/master/misc/cpantesters.pl>
that you can also run for yourself.
